Mediterranean chicken and rice is one of my favorite easy meals to make. If
you can shake seasonings up in a bag with liquid, and cook some chicken up in
a pan you can make this meal. It's relatively low effort and is really tasty.
The `Variable sides` section can be adjusted per your intake needs as well so
this makes a good cut meal.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Start cooking the brown rice, I recommend the mediterranean blend
  noted here: 
- Juice the lemons.
- Add the lemon juice, olive oil, and vinegar to your zip-top bag.
- Add all spices, close the bag, and shake to combine.
- Trim chicken and place in bag, you may wish to pound chicken thin if
  especially thick.
- Make sure all of the chicken breasts are covered by the marinade. Place
  the bag in a large bowl, and place in the fridge to marinate for 1 hour.
- Once the brown rice is nearly done remove the chicken from the bag and dry
  on paper towels, pat dry any excess liquid.
- Heat a frying pan and add the coconut oil, once oil is hot add chicken
  breast.
- Cook until internal temperature of chicken is equal to 165 degrees.
- Let rest for 3 minutes, then dice into either strips or chunks, your choice.
- Plate the brown rice, and hummus (if eating), top with chicken, veggies and
  cover in the greek yogurt sauce
