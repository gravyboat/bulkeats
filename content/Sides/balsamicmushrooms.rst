Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Begin by preheating your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 C).
- Wash and dry mushrooms.
- Finely dice the garlic
- Mix the oil, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper in a
  large bowl.
- Add the mushrooms to this mixture, stirring to coat thoroughly.
- Allow mixture to marinate for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes so
  mushrooms are evenly coated. DO NOT allow to marinate for more than 15
  minutes. If you do this the balsamic vinegar will be overpowering.
- Pour the mushrooms onto a baking sheet in a single layer.
- Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring once half way through the cooking time.
- Finely chop the parsley and sprinkle on top when serving.
