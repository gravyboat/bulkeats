**Does Bulk Eat Do Any Tracking?**

Nope, The Bulk Eats team doesn't believe that tracking products positively
impact our visitors so we don't use them. The only tracking that occurs is
via our server log files when you visit in the event something goes wrong and
we need to troubleshoot. This information typically includes your IP address,
browser version, and a timestamp for when you visited. This information is not
harvested, sold, or collected in any way that would result in user tracking
of any kind.

**Amazon and Affiliate Links (How We Make Money)**

Bulk Eats is proud to provide a variety of free recipes and articles related
to nutrition to help people put on weight, or just cook in bulk quantities so
they stay motivated to continue improving themselves while avoiding a dull and
repetitive diet. When you click on an Amazon affiliate link on our site to
purchase a product a small amount of that purchase is given to Bulk Eats.
Products provided via affiliate links do not influence the Bulk Eats team,
they are simply products that have been used and have aided in cooking large
quantities of food.

**Required Amazon Affiliate Note**

We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an
