Turkey burgers are probably one of my favorite things to make when seasoned
properly. They're simple to make and you can eat whatever sides you like with
them which is great for switching things up. They make decent leftovers and
you can use them for cutting as well.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Start by heating up the pan, dicing the yellow onion, and mincing the garlic.
- Once hot add the coconut oil, when nearly smoking add ground turkey breast
  and use a wooden spoon to break up the turkey as it cooks.
- Add Salt and pepper.
- Once turkey has lost most pink color add the yellow onion.
- Once turkey is no longer pink and onion has started to become translucent
  add the tomato sauce, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, ketchup, tomato paste,
  mined garlic, and spices. Mix well.
- Turn down the heat to simmer so there is a small amount of bubbling going,
  continue breaking up the turkey until you have reached your desired
  consistency.
- If it's not saucy enough for you add some water, this will mix with
  everything else and can help, otherwise continue simmering, seasoning, and
  tasting every 15 minutes.
- Once a thick sauce has been formed with the turkey incorporated and you are
  happy with the seasoning spoon onto buns and eat.

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.
