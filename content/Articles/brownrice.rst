I'm presenting would be the same either way. It took a while to find these
products so I see no reason not to share them.


As you can see based on many of the recipes on the site eating brown rice is
an easy and cheap staple to bulk up. The main downside is that brown rice is
nowhere near as satisfying as brown rice. I've been eating brown rice regularly
for about 4 years now, and after 6 months or so I got quite tired of it,
thinking there have to be better ways to prepare this rice to make it more
appealing and better tasting. So after nearly four years I've put together some
essential tips that make brown rice much more appealing.

Use Long Grain Brown Rice
-------------------------

Short grain rices are typically used in applications where you want sticky
rice, this is the simplest tip and it improves things a lot to me because I
don't want sticky rice for most recipes. So unless you need it for something
specific go with long grain brown rice.

Wash Your Rice
--------------

If you aren't already washing your brown rice before you eat it, you're
missing out. When washing your rice you can either do so in a collander, or
directly in the bowl of your rice cooker. I prefer using a collander designed
for rice as it makes it much easier to wash, and benefits us in a few points
when I talk about the power of broth. I'm using this collander which is meant
for rice. Washing your rice helps to get rid of some of the hulls since eating
those sucks and they're much more common with brown rice.

Recognize That the Cup Measure From Your Rice Cooker Isn't a Real Cup Measure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one is actually kind of annoying. Most rice cookers have some kind of
cup that they come with that isn't an actual cup measure, that's why I'm
putting quotes around 'cup' every time I use it going forward, this is two
rice cooker cups, and for me it makes about 4 cooked cups of rice (I don't
do this for recipes and instead just look at cooked cups of rice).
Understanding this can help you make better rice.

Use a Rice Cooker
-----------------

The biggest one on this list and a major life changer for me. I've used my
rice cooker for at least 500 batches of rice at this point and it's much
easier and makes clean up faster. The downside of using a rice cooker for
brown rice is that it cooks slower. I'm using a smaller (2 'cup') Zojirushi
rice cooker and it makes great brown rice every time. You might considering
upgrading to this one, as I've heard it makes brown rice faster, and it's
larger in the event you're doing meal prep where you don't want to make rice
a few times a week. Either way, a rice cooker made me go from hating brown
rice to loving it, I cannot stress how much better this makes things.

Add Oil to Your Rice
--------------------

Once the rice is washed I like to add a small amount of olive oil to my rice.
This doesn't have to be anything insane, a teaspoon or less (I don't even
measure it any more since I'm so good at eye balling it) for 2 'cups' of rice
and it keeps the rice from sticking to itself too much, it also makes the rice
taste a little richer which I appreciate. Overall this is one of the most
important additions to me for brown rice and I do it no matter what.

Use Broth Instead of Water
--------------------------

Using broth instead of water is the second best thing you can do in the cooking
process to enhance the flavor of your rice. Chicken broth is my preferred,
though you can use beef broth. Vegetable broth is okay if you're vegetarian but
it can leave behind some material once you've cooked the rice which looks less
than appetizing. I usually just go with chicken, it adds to my rice no matter
what I'm making

A Splash of Soy Sauce For Umami
-------------------------------

The idea of umami isn't a new one, but for rice it can be especially impactful.
Add a teaspoon of soy sauce to your rice when you're adding your broth and oil
and it won't add much flavor, but it will contribute to the richness.

Add Seasoning
-------------

Blasphemous to some, but delicious to me, I season ALL brown rice, this is a
non-negotiable aspect of making brown rice. If I'm making Mexican food I use
a Mexican blend, if it's Meditteranean, then it's going to be turned into a
yellow brown rice, I've included a few of my basics below. I usually just
rotate between three spice combos I've included as they're my favorite
and they cover most things.

Let Your Rice Sit
-----------------

This one is very minimal and I don't do it every time, but letting your rice
sit in your broth/oil/soy sauce/spice mixture for ~30 minutes before cooking it
can improve the texture of your brown rice. I rarely do this because brown rice
already takes so long to cook I don't want to wait another 30 minutes. If you
have a programmable rice cooker you could always do this just by letting the
rice sit around for a time.

Spice Mixes
-----------

These spices mixes don't have volumes of the spices since you might be making
different amounts of rice, they're just a list of spices that work together
very well in addition the tips above. You don't have to use everything in the
mixes, they're just guidelines that I've discovered after years of making
brown rice that lead to very tasty rice.
