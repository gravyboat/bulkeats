Turkey burgers are probably one of my favorite things to make when seasoned
properly. They're simple to make and you can eat whatever sides you like with
them which is great for switching things up. They make decent leftovers and
you can use them for cutting as well.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Mix the spices, egg, soy sauce, and worcestershire sauce in a large bowl
- Add the ground turkey breast to the bowl and mix thoroughly to combine
- Form 4 patties approximately 1/2 lb (226g) each, you want to make sure these
  aren't too thick or they won't cook all the way, they will be loose so just
  form them as well as you can
- Heat up the skillet(s) and when water immediately sizzles off add the coconut
  oil (ONLY WHEN THERE IS NO WATER REMAINING)
- Make sure the oil properly coats the pan, and once it's shimmering add your
  turkey patties
- Reduce heat to medium and allow patties to cook, after ~6-8 minutes check
  bottom of patties, if a crust is formed flip them over and start cooking
  the second side
- Once 6-8 minutes have elapsed on the second side use the thermometer to
  confirm the insides have reached 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74C)
- Remove patties from pan and allow to rest for 2 minutes
- Top with any toppings you want and plate with your sides

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.
