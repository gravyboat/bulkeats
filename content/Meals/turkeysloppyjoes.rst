Turkey sloppy joes are easy, relatively fast, and very simple to add calories
on to with a variety of sides. They're great as leftovers and each meal can
feel different depending on which sides you choose to eat with it. It's also a
decent meal for cutting.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Start by heating up the pan, dicing the yellow onion, and mincing the garlic.
- Once hot add the coconut oil, when nearly smoking add ground turkey breast
  and use a wooden spoon to break up the turkey as it cooks.
- Add Salt and pepper.
- Once turkey has lost most pink color add the yellow onion.
- Once turkey is no longer pink and onion has started to become translucent
  add the tomato sauce, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, ketchup, tomato paste,
  mined garlic, and spices. Mix well.
- Turn down the heat to simmer so there is a small amount of bubbling going,
  continue breaking up the turkey until you have reached your desired
  consistency.
- If it's not saucy enough for you add some water, this will mix with
  everything else and can help, otherwise continue simmering, seasoning, and
  tasting every 15 minutes.
- Once a thick sauce has been formed with the turkey incorporated and you are
  happy with the seasoning spoon onto buns and eat.

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.
