Cooking sous vide is one of those things I thought was overrated for a long
time, but it really isn't. It makes cooking so easy that I sometimes forget
what a pain it can be to cook 4 lbs of chicken without my sous vide cooker.
Let's take a look at a few things that might help you decide if a sous vide
cooker is a worthwhile investment for you.

I'm presenting helped make my sous vide cooking easier, so I want to share it.

There are a number of recipes on Bulk Eats that talk about cooking
chicken breast and eating it alongside other things. About two years ago I
purchased a sous video cooker. Originally it was for red meat, but I learned
what truly makes it amazing is helping to cook the juiciest and most tender
chicken I've ever eaten. Any pictures you see on the site where it's just
a cooked and sliced chicken breast has been cooked via sous vide. So with
that let's get to talking about why sous vide is so awesome for bulking.

Sous Vide Lets You Cook in Bulk
-------------------------------

I hate batch cooking with a passion, so much so that I would often overload
my pans to get my chicken cooked more quickly, and this is the top thing
that sous vide cooking helps me avoid. I use a large plastic restaurant style
container that my sous vide cooker attaches to, and it holds quite a lot of
water, which means it holds a lot of food. I typically cook 4 pounds of
chicken split between multiple bags at one time. This means I can have half
a week's worth of chicken breast ready to go all at once. This is a huge time
save for me and the avoidance of batch cooking makes things a lot cleaner and
a lot less stressful for me meal prep.

Sous Vide Means Sauteing is Fast
--------------------------------

One of the most powerful aspects of sous vide for me revolves around meal
prep. As I noted you can cook in bulk, and due to this you can finish your
meat very quickly. Since it's already up to temperature and cooked, you only
need 30 seconds to a minute on each side in a hot pan with a small amount of
oil to get the delicious power that is the
`Maillard reaction <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction>`_. So with
sous vide I typically have 8 chicken breast halves, which I then cook two at a
time in a pan. This means all my chicken is nice and golden on the outside in
4-5 minutes total. A huge improvement over batch cooking for upwards of 20-30
minutes, and I ensure that every piece of chicken, no matter how thick has
the ideal internal temperature with a nice golden crust. It really makes
things easy.

Sous Vide is Hands Off
----------------------

The process for cooking via sous vide is extremely simple:

- Fill the container with water.
- Place the sous vide cooker in the water and plug it in.
- Turn it on and adjust to the proper temperature.
- Wait for water to come up to temp (trim and season meat a few minutes
  prior to the temperature being reached).
- Place your meat in a zip-top bag.
- Submerge bag with one corner still open to allow air to escape.
- Wait for meat to be finished cooking.

It's so easy it still blows me away sometimes how good things turn out. If you
can trim a chicken breast, fill a container with water, and plug a device in
you can cook sous vide and make delicious meals.

Sous Vide Isn't Really That Expensive
-------------------------------------

A lot of people are opposed to sous vide cooking because they think it's too
expensive when it really isn't. Cookers keep coming down in price, and you
don't need some fancy vacuum bag sealer. I've been using what is referred to
as the water immersion method since I bought my cooker and food still turns
out excellent. You just need the cooker, a container (preferably a lid also),
and some zip-top bags and you can start cooking sous vide. Anything past that
is just fancy add-ons. I've got Amazon links at the bottom where you can
purchase all of these items minus the bags directly, but let's total it up
real quick:

- Sous vide cooker: $109 (I paid a bit more than this originally)
- Polycarbonate storage container: $24
- Container lid: $6
- Box of 40 high quality quart size zip-top bags: $5

So the total investment made for cooking sous vide is $143 plus a little in
electricity/water for your first 20-40 times depending on how heavily you load
up your bags (and I don't like to do more than 2lbs per bag max). While sous
vide definitely isn't an extremely low cost of entry style of cooking, a lot
of the cost is offset to me because I don't have to either bake a ton of
chicken and make my living space hot, or deal with batch cooking. The time
I've saved from not having to batch cook alone over the past two years has
made it 100% worth the price. I don't have to monitor my chicken, I just bag
it up and let it go.

Sous Vide Meat Just Tastes Good
-------------------------------

Probably the most subjective of the bunch in this article, but I just really
enjoy cooking sous vide. I can do multiple dry spice rubs at once if I want
in the same container of water but using different bags. I don't have to
worry about overcooking or under cooking depending on the size of the chicken
breast. Another one of my favorite things to make that would be hard to make
via other means is lunch meat. I make my own turkey breast lunch meat for much
cheaper than what they charge at the store, and it doesn't have any
preservatives plus it's much lower in sodium than what you could buy.

Sous Vide Downsides
-------------------

The downsides I've found so far when cooking sous vide is it doesn't do very
well with wet marinades that contain an acid. I tried some lemon marinated
chicken (from my mediterranean chicken recipe) and it didn't turn out great.
The combination of the temperature, plus the long exposure to the acids
broke down the chicken more than I would have liked. The other main downside
is that it takes longer than traditional cooking, even if you do batch
cooking. For me it's worth it because it's delicious 100% of the time, but
it's something to consider. I also had to buy a larger container, because
my largest stock pot didn't have enough space. In the end this has been
a plus, but it's a possible annoyance if you try to use a regular pot all the
time. 

My Sous Vide Setup
------------------

I own the following products for cooking sous vide, and cut a hole in the
container lid which the cooker goes through to reduce heat loss. Apparently
there are now some manufacturers selling lids that fit around the cooker more
precisely but that didn't exist when I purchased mine, and there's no way I'm
spending $20 for a plastic lid when I can just cut a hole myself:
