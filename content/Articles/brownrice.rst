Brown rice is an essential park of my bulking diet, it's extremely easy to
make and provides a huge chunk of my nutrition needs. Rice is also one of
the cheapest fillers you're going to be able to find, which makes it great
when you're trying to bulk on a budget.

is an incentive behind having you click on them. That being said the advice
I'm presenting and these tips are still beneficial even without a rice cooker.

The Preamble
------------

As you can see based on many of the recipes on the site eating brown rice is
an easy and cheap staple to bulk up on. The main downside is that brown rice is
nowhere near as satisfying as white rice. I've been eating brown rice regularly
for about 4 years now and after 6 months or so I got quite tired of it,
thinking there have to be better ways to prepare this rice to make it more
appealing and better tasting. So after three years of trial and error I've put
together some essential tips that make brown rice much more appealing.

Use Long Grain Brown Rice
-------------------------

Short grain rices are typically used in applications where you want sticky
rice, this is the simplest tip and it improves things a lot to me because I
don't want sticky rice for most recipes. So unless you need it for something
specific go with long grain brown rice.

Wash Your Rice
--------------

If you aren't already washing your brown rice before you eat it, you're
missing out. When washing your rice you can either do so in a colander, or
directly in the bowl of your rice cooker. I prefer using a colander designed
for rice as it makes it much easier to wash, and benefits us in a few points
when I talk about the power of broth. I'm using a colander which is meant
for rice which I've linked below. Washing your rice helps to get rid of some
of the hulls since eating those sucks and they're much more common with brown
rice than white rice.

Use a Rice Cooker
-----------------

The biggest one on this list and a major life changer for me. I've used my
rice cooker for at least 500 batches of rice at this point and it's much
easier and makes clean up faster. The downside of using a rice cooker for
brown rice is that it cooks slower. I'm using a smaller (2 'cups' of brown
rice max) Zojirushi rice cooker and it makes great brown rice every time.
You might considering upgrading to the second one I have linked, as I've heard
it makes brown rice faster, and it's larger in the event you're doing meal
prep where you don't want to make rice a few times a week. I don't really
worry about this since my rice cooker is programmable so I just set it for
when I want the rice and it's ready to go, but for some people this might be
a big deal. Either way, a rice cooker made me go from hating brown rice to
loving it, I cannot stress how much better this makes eating a lot of rice.

Recognize That the Cup Measure From Your Rice Cooker Isn't a Real Cup Measure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This one is actually kind of annoying. Most rice cookers have some kind of
cup that they come with that isn't an actual cup measure, that's why I'm
putting quotes around 'cup' every time I use it going forward, this is two
rice cooker 'cups', and for me it makes about 4 cooked cups of rice (I don't
do this for recipes and instead just look at cooked cups of rice and their
equivalent weight in grams). Understanding this can help you make better rice.

Add Oil to Your Rice
--------------------

Once the rice is washed I like to add a small amount of olive oil to my rice.
This doesn't have to be anything outrageous, a teaspoon or less (I don't even
measure it any more since I'm used at eye balling it) for 2 'cups' of rice
and it keeps the rice from sticking to itself too much, it also makes the rice
taste a little richer and smoother which I appreciate. Overall this is one of
the most important additions to me for brown rice and I do it no matter what.

Use Broth Instead of Water
--------------------------

Using broth instead of water is the second best thing you can do in the cooking
process to enhance the flavor of your rice. Chicken broth is my preference,
though you can use beef broth. Vegetable broth is okay if you're vegetarian but
it can leave behind some material once you've cooked the rice which looks less
than appetizing. I usually just go with chicken, it adds to my rice no matter
what I'm making. Make sure no matter what kind of broth you use that it's low
sodium

A Splash of Soy Sauce For Umami
-------------------------------

The idea of umami isn't a new one, but for rice it can be especially impactful.
Add a teaspoon of soy sauce to your rice when you're adding your broth and oil
and it won't add much flavor, but it will contribute to the richness.

Let Your Rice Sit
-----------------

This one is very minimal and I don't do it every time, but letting your rice
sit in your broth/oil/soy sauce/spice mixture for ~30 minutes before cooking it
can improve the texture of your brown rice. I rarely do this because brown rice
already takes so long to cook I don't want to wait another 30 minutes. If you
have a programmable rice cooker you could always do this just by letting the
rice sit around for a time.

Add Seasoning
-------------

Blasphemous to some, but delicious to me, I season ALL brown rice, this is a
non-negotiable aspect of making brown rice. If I'm making Mexican food I use
a Mexican blend, if it's mediterranean, then it's going to be turned into a
yellow brown rice, etc., I've included a few of my basics below. I usually just
rotate between the three spice combos I've included as they're my favorite
and they cover most things.


Spice Mixes
-----------

These spices mixes don't have volumes of the spices since you might be making
different amounts of rice, they're just a list of spices that work together
very well in addition the tips above. You don't have to use everything in the
mixes, they're just guidelines that I've discovered after years of making
brown rice that lead to very tasty rice.

- Cumin
