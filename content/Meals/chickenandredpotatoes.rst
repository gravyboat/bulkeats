This is another easy dish where you can make the chicken sous vide (please
review my `sous vide article <>`_ if you're thinking about that) if you want
to, or just in a pan. Keep in mind that we lose 15-20% of the potatoes weight
when they're cooked, so while we buy 6 pounds, we're losing nearly 1/4 of that.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Begin by preheating your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 C).
- Wash and quarter (cut into 4 pieces) all potatoes. Don't cut these too
  small! We're cooking so much food here that they still won't get an
  extremely crispy texture, so we need to minimize surface area as much as
  possible.
- Dice the red pepper into small chunks, or your preferred shape.
- Pour the olive oil into your baking vessel and place the potatoes and bell
  peppers in. Stir around to coat with the oil, then sprinkle on the salt,
  pepper, and cayenne pepper.
- Place in the oven and stir around the potatoes and peppers every 30 minutes.
  Try to make sure sides that haven't browned are touching the bottom if you
  can.
- Once an hour has passed see if the potatoes are done and crisped to your
  preference, if so turn off the oven and allow them to rest for 20 minutes,
  if not continue cooking, making sure to watch the peppers so they don't burn.
- Once the potatoes are resting heat up the pan for your chicken, and trim the
  chicken breast (you may need to pound the breasts thin to ensure even
  cooking).
- Once the pan is hot, add the oil, and sprinkle the chicken with salt and
  pepper, you may wish to do other spice combinations as well, just keep in
  mind that some spices may burn badly when exposed to the hot oil.
- Turn the heat down to medium and place the chicken in the pan, turning every
  8 minutes, or when a golden brown crust has formed.
- Once chicken is done cooking (check with a meat thermometer to avoid
  overcooking) remove from the pan and allow to rest for 3 minutes before
  serving. While this is happening taste the potatoes and adjust seasoning as
  needed, they will probably need more salt and pepper.
- Plate the chicken with the potatoes and other sides.

.. note::
    I recommend a container with a heavier bottom than the baking sheets
    for cooking the potatoes, but since I don't have one I wouldn't feel
    comfortable making a recommendation. The baking sheets are cheap and work
    but you might get red peppers that are a little more roasted than you
    prefer.
