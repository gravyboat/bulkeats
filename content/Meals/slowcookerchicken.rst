Slow cooker chicken is one of those meals you can eat over and over again.
It's one of my favorites on the list because it's so low effort and turns out
delicious every time. You can also make your own beans to reduce costs.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Open and drain all the cans of beans, we don't want extra liquid
- Dice the yellow onion and cilantro
- Trim your chicken breast and cut them in half length wise so they are
  thinner.
- Dump the beans, onions, cilantro, salsa, and spices into your crock
  pot then stir them all up
- Juice the lime into this mixture
- Add the chicken breast and stir to combine
- Cook on high for 6 hours, at the 5 hour mark take the top off and use two
  forks to shred the chicken then mix it back in.
- Season to taste, you will most likely need more salt
- In the event you have too much liquid you can always transfer it to a large
  pot/pan and boil off the excess liquid
- Serve over rice with the tortillas (or other sides) and top with anything
  you want, for extra calories you can add on diced avocado, sour cream, or a
  variety of other things.

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.
