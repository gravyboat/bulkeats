Chicken Fajitas
===============
:date: 2017-02-14
:tags: meals, leftovers

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.

Chicken fajitas are an easy meal you can add calories on to with minimal work.
These fajitas are cooked in a single pan. This means they will lack the famous
grill marks. In addition I mix these with brown rice once they finish cooking
and pack them into tortillas for more calories. The `Variable sides` section
can be adjusted per your intake needs.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Start by getting your brown rice cooking, I use a rice cooker for this
  because it's easier for me to manage. Cook your rice however you prefer,
  I am assuming a 2 hour cook time.
- Combine the spices listed above in a zip top bag along with the juice from
  the limes and olive oil. Close and shake vigoriously to combine.
- Prep chicken and cut into thin slices (however big you prefer to eat in a bite)
  and put these in the bag with the marinade. Close the marinade bag and shake
  again to ensure all pieces are coated, place the bag into a bowl and put this
  in the refridgerator for 45 minutes, once this time has elapsed flip the bag.
- When your brown rice is approximatey 30 minutes from being done slice the
  green pepper, red pepper, and onion, again to your preference.
- Heat up a large pan or dutch oven over medium/high heat and once it is hot
  place the coconut oil into the pan. Immediately add your onions and peppers,
  and sprinkle with salt. Stir as needed to ensure all vegetables are cooking
  evenly.
- Once vegetables are most of the way to your desired doneness create a space in
  the middle of the pan.
- Remove the chicken from the bag, and dump the contents of the bag (chicken
  and marinade) into the pan with the vegetables, you may need to turn up the
  heat at this point, try to ensure as much contact between the pan and chicken
  pieces so they cook.
- Once the chicken is done cooking turn off the heat, at this point your brown
  rice should be done cooking.
- If the pan is large enough add the rice and stir to combine, serve immediately
  with your preferred toppings.
