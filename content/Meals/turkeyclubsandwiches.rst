Turkey Club Sandwiches
======================

Chicken fajitas are an easy meal you can add calories on to with minimal work.
These fajitas are cooked in a single pan. This means they will lack the famous
grill marks. In addition I mix these with brown rice once they finish cooking
and pack them into tortillas for more calories. The `Variable sides` section
can be adjusted per your intake needs.
