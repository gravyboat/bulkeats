Probably the easiest snack to make that you'll ever eat, but one of
my favorites due to high calorie and decent protein content. It's pretty
filling and it works great as a dessert too.

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.
