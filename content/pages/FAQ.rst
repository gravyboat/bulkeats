**Amazon and Affiliate Links**

Bulk Eats is proud to provide a variety of free recipes and articles related
to realistic nutrition for every day individuals that don't want to spend
their whole life eating the same thing. When you click on an Amazon affiliate
link on our site to purchase a product a small amount of that purchase is
given to Bulk Eats. Products provided via affiliate links do not influence
the Bulk Eats team in anyway. Typically these are products that have been
used for years to help make these recipes a reality.

**Required Amazon Affiliate note**

We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an
affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees
by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.
