time you let it cook, the better it gets. This recipe has a long cook time
with minimal work past the initial steps, you just need to leave it alone with
occasional checks and it will become delicious. Due to this it also makes

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Heat your large pan/dutch oven and put all meat into it so it begins to cook.
- While the meat is cooking dice the onion and celery, and grate the carrot
  and garlic.
- Once the meat has lost some of the pink color add the onion, celery, carrot,
  and garlic.
- Add half of the spices minus the bay leaf and stir to combine, continue
  stirring occasionally.
- Preheat oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 Celsius), make sure the rack is
  at the lowest point.
- Pour tomatoes from cans into a large container or bowl, remove any stem
  sections (where the stem would meet the tomato itself), basil leaves, or
  inedible chunks you may find, then using your hand crush the tomatoes to
  your desire consistency (I like relatively smooth with a few chunks).
- Once the meat is cooked and the vegetables are fragrant and have become soft
  add the tomatoes.
- Stir to combine, add the rest of the seasonings and the bay leaf, bring to a
  boil.
- Once the sauce is boiling turn off the heat, and transfer the sauce
  uncovered to the oven.
- Stir every 30 minutes (tasting and adding salt/pepper/spices as needed)
  until sauce has reduced and is quite thick, at least 2 hours.
- Once sauce is nearly finished heat a pot of water until boiling, add 1/4
  of the box of pasta and cook until done.
- Drain pasta and add to a bowl along with 1/4 of the sauce. Serve with sides
  if desired.

side preparation:

- For the garlic bread begin by placing 2 tablespoons butter into a container.
- Grate garlic and add to the butter, at this point also add the spices.
- Cut the bread in half, and then lengthwise to create 4 sections.
- Spread the garlic butter onto the bread, then cook under a low broiler
  for 3-5 minutes, or until desired texture is achieved, serve along side main
  dish.

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.
