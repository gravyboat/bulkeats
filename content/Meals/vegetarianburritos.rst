These vegetarian burritos are pretty easy to make and turn out good. They
aren't the kind of leftover you want to bring to work, but they're great for
dinner when you don't want to cook again. It's also really easy to adjust
these for your taste, and there's a huge variety of toppings available.

  vegetarian crumbles will work, so boca, morningstar, generic brands, and
  even TVP, though I've found the Beyond Meat product provides the best
  texture)

  fresh), (64 oz, 1816g), (1680 calories, 84g protein, 252g carbs, 35g fat)

Variable Sides
--------------

This meal doesn't have any additional sides, however you could add on other
assorted items depending on your caloric needs. I find that it's unnecessary
due to this being a pretty heavy meal already, especially if your toppings
include things like sour cream, cheese, etc.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Mix the spices noted above together into some kind of container.
- Heat up a large skillet.
- Once the skillet is hot add the oil and meat substitute.
- Stir until all meat substitute is no longer frozen.
- Add spices and broth, stir to combine. Increase heat and bring to a boil.
  There should be enough broth to cover most of the meat substitute, but not
  so much as to turn it into a soup, doing that will destroy the texture.
- Once boiling reduce to a simmer, stirring occasionally (liquid should be
  evaporating slowly).
- Over the next 30-45 minutes the liquid should reduce, keep stirring
  occasionally.
- Once the liquid is mostly reduced put the can of beans into your small
  skillet, add any spices/hot sauce/liquid you like and heat them up.
- Prepare any vegetables/toppings you may desire (lettuce, tomatoes, green
  onion, cheese, etc.)
- Once you can clearly drag a spoon along the bottom of the meat substitute
  and liquid does not immediately fill the space it's ready. The liquid should
  generally be gone, and what little liquid remains should be a thick sauce.
- Combine beans, meat substitute, and toppings in a tortilla and fold, if you
  decide to toast the tortillas place them in the medium sized skillet at
  medium/high heat, flip once browned on the bottom and serve.

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.
