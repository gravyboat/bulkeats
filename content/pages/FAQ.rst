**Does Bulk Eat Do Any Tracking?**

Nope, The Bulk Eats team doesn't believe that tracking products positively
impact our visitors so we don't use them. The only tracking that occurs is
via our server log files when you visit in the event something goes wrong and
we need to troubleshoot. This information typically includes your IP address,
browser version, and a timestamp for when you visited. This information is not
harvested, sold, or collected in any way that would result in user tracking
of any kind.
