Swedish meatball slop as I like to call it just deconstructs the idea of
meatballs to make the meal easier to prepare and make in large quantities. It's
a one pan dish, though you will need a few containers.

Preparation Instructions
------------------------

- Start by finely dicing the onion, chopping the zucchini, whole or halves
  depending on your preferred size, and dicing the mushrooms.
- Get a large pot of water that can hold all of your pasta started so it will
  be boiling in about 15 minutes
- In a LARGE heavy bottom pan add some olive oil, heat it up, and then add
  the onion, zucchini, and mushrooms along with some salt, stir as needed. 
- While this is cooking mix the ground turkey, eggs, allspice, nutmeg,
  and HALF of the dill, along with some salt and pepper, then add half of the
  Worcestershire sauce. Mix this all up.
- After about 10-12 minutes your veggies should be cooked down.
  Dump the turkey mixture into the pot and begin browning the turkey so it's
  cooked completely. Once this is done (there may be a small amount of liquid
  left in the bottom of the pan, don't worry about it) dump this into some
  other container.
- Now it's time to make the sauce. Start by melting the butter in the same pan
  (if there are some remnants left don't worry about it).
- Once the butter has melted add the flour and cook until it's no longer raw.
  It may get a bit doughy/not mix, this is okay, just start adding small
  amounts of broth, but try to avoid large clumps if you can, you may wish to
  wisk it.
- Once you have this incorporated add the rest of the broth and bring this to
  a boil, it should have a pretty good consistency that seems a bit loose,
  but isn't straight up liquid.
- Dump your meat and veggie mix back into the pot, add the rest of the
  Worcestershire sauce, and dill. At this point it comes down to your
  personal preference of taste.
- Once everything is boiling again (make sure to stir frequently) add the
  yogurt. You may need less than noted here depending on your preference, you
  basically want the sauce to get lighter in color, stir and taste until
  you're happy.
- At this point your water should be ready for the pasta, boil it for the time
  on the package and drain it, then add it to the sauce/meat mix.
- Allow it to cook for another 5-10 minutes to get some of the starch from the
  pasta into the sauce. At this point you're ready to eat, adjust seasoning as needed.

As usual all weight/calories/protein for things like meat are taken in an
uncooked state and will be noted as such since there's too many variables. All
nutrition values are taken from a Google search such as
`yellow onion nutrition`. This means that nutritional counts may be slightly
inaccurate, these are all approximations.
